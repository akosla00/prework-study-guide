# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

For this class, I wanted to build a prework study guide webpage to use to study what I've learned so far before the actual bootcamp begins. This webpage provides me with not only information I can use to study, but also experience in using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git before the class begins. Allowing me to be more comfortable and confident in my performance during the upcoming bootcamp.

## Usage

You can use this webpage to study topics discussed in the prework portion of the coding bootcamp. Each section contains notes and other information, such as definitions and commands, for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. You can also open the DevTools console to see JavaScript running on the webpage. It can list topics we discussed, as well as chooses one at random for us to study.
